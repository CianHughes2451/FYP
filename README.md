This research explores important metrics related to soccer statistics, including shots per goal, passing sequences, recovering control in goal-scoring locations, and capitalising on turnovers all over the pitch. Fuelled by the groundbreaking work of Charles Reep, who notated over 2200 football matches by hand starting in 1950, inventing his own shorthand to do so, this study attempts to evaluate the applicability and reliability of Reep's findings in the modern game. Using an extensive dataset of spatio-temporal match data for Europe’s top 5 leagues the 207/18 season and two international tournaments from 2016 and 2018, advanced analytical and statistical techniques are applied to dissect trends and patterns that arise within leagues and teams alike. Through juxtaposing Reep's "long-ball tactics” with the contemporary style of play, this research aims to highlight the evolution of soccer tactics and the persistent ideas that underpin goal-scoring schemes. Our results offer important new perspectives on the dynamic interaction between traditional thinking and technological advances in “the beautiful game.”
